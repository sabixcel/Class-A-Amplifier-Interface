# Class-A-Amplifier-Interface

This project provides a GUI with functionalities for a Class-A Amplifier, made in Matlab. 

Design specifications:
-vBE,on=0.7V;
-IBias=0.2A;
-RL=60Î©;
Requirements: 
-draw VTC vO(vI) and indicate the transistor state (off, aF, exc) for every region of VTC;
-consider vI=0.7V+6sin(wt)[V], draw the waveforms for vO(i), iO(t), vCE(t) and iC(t) and specify the peak values for the signals;
-calculate the average value of the power dissipated by the load and average efficiency for vI=0.7V+0.6sin(wt)[V];
-explain why the average efficiency is less than the maximum average efficiency possible for this stage.
